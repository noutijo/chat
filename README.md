# libs

For the functioning of the application, it requires that some libraries are integrated in the project. So, you have to integrate the libraries that are in the `/libs` folder in your project.
Note that this project is designed with `JDK 1.8`.

# How it works

`First your have to launch server`

To start the server, execute the `Launch.java` class in the `src/server` root.
then define a port (for example : `2000`) and click on connection.

`Client side`

After starting the server, you have to launch the client run the `Launch.java` class in the `src/client` root. Then set the same port (for example : `2000`) you have set on the server side and click on connection.
